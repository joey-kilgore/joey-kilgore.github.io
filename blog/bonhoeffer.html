            <div>
                <div><br></div>
                <div>When David and I met a few months back for lunch, I mentioned I had read through</div>
                <div>Bonhoeffer (a 600-page tome), and he asked if I would be interested in talking about</div>
                <div>Bonhoeffer for our series on the Saints. To be completely honest, I felt a bit intimidated,</div>
                <div>but David reminded me I just read 600 pages on him, and I only have 30 minutes to talk</div>
                <div>anyways! Still a bit intimidated, I proceeded to buy as many books as I could from Amazon</div>
                <div>written by Bonhoeffer. Now a few months later, here we are, and I couldn’t be more excited</div>
                <div>to talk about one of the many examples of people who have lived out what it means to truly</div>
                <div>follow Christ.</div>
                <div>Bonhoeffer and I actually have a lot in common. His father was also an academic. He grew</div>
                <div>up with a large family, though his family of eight siblings certainly tops my five.<span>&nbsp;</span>He too was</div>
                <div>a pianist, and I imagine he would have enjoyed Keith Green as well, and while I’m still</div>
                <div>working on my PhD, Bonhoeffer received his Doctor of Theology degree at the age of 21</div>
                <div>from the University in Berlin in 1927 with his thesis titled “Sanctorum Communio”.</div>
                <div>He had a wonderfully educated and thoughtful family. Along with a grandmother, who later</div>
                <div>at the age of 91 was told by nazi guards she could no longer shop at her normal department</div>
                <div>store because it was run by Jews, she promptly told the guards “She would shop where she</div>
                <div>liked and did so…ignoring the silly kick line of SA men stationed in front.” [p. 156-157]</div>
                <div>While this family had a wide array of talents, pietist religion was certainly not one of them.</div>
                <div>Rather than regularly attending church, typically only going for more “important” services,</div>
                <div>they had a home regularly filled with scripture. Even as their father may have not described</div>
                <div>himself as Christian [p. 14], his wife’s faith “was most evident in the values that she and</div>
                <div>her husband taught their children” [p. 12]. Sabine, Bonhoeffer’s beloved twin sister,</div>
                <div>remembered “in all that pertained to our education, our parents stood united as a wall.</div>
                <div>There was no question of one saying one thing and the other saying something else” [p. 14].</div>
                <div>Furthermore, Sabine mentions “[her father possessed] great tolerance that left no room for</div>
                <div>narrow-mindedness and broadened the horizons of our home. He took it for granted that</div>
                <div>he would try to do what was right and expected much from us” [p.15].</div>
                <div><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
            </div>
            <div><br></div>
        </div>
        <div id="pf2">
            <div>
                <div><br></div>
                <div>“Karl Bonhoeffer taught his children to speak only when they had something to say. He did</div>
                <div>not tolerate sloppiness of expression any more than he tolerated self-pity or boastful</div>
                <div>pride” [p. 15]. One could say that this house had no place for a “cheap grace”, a phrase</div>
                <div>that Dietrich would later expand into his early and great work <span>The Cost of Discipleship</span>.</div>
                <div>If we are to have one takeaway from this, it was that Bonhoeffer had a complete faith in</div>
                <div>knowing “for by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it</div>
                <div>is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. We are his workmanship,</div>
                <div>created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, <span>that we should&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div>walk in them<span>” [Eph 2:8-10]. Even further, he&nbsp;</span>knew<span>&nbsp;that God had an individual plan for each&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div>person, and God’s plan for Bonhoeffer was filled with twists, turns, subversion, and</div>
                <div>imprisonment. But to understand more about what Bonhoeffer stood for, we must know</div>
                <div>what he stood against.</div>
                <div>Within one month of Adolf Hittler being chosen as Chancellor, the Reichstag, which is the</div>
                <div>German parliamentary building, was set ablaze, and Hitler was able to push an emergency</div>
                <div>decree:</div>
                <div>“Restrictions on personal liberty, on the right of free expression of opinion, including</div>
                <div>freedom of the press; on the rights of assembly and association; and violations of the</div>
                <div>privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications; and warrants for house</div>
                <div>searches, orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property, are also permissible</div>
                <div>beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed.” [p.149] Essentially, beginning his reign of</div>
                <div>being above the law.</div>
                <div>While most of us probably know a lot about this failed Austrian artist turned dictator, I</div>
                <div>found it interesting to learn about Hitler’s relationship, or should I say want to control, over</div>
                <div>the Church in Germany. Hitler had a deep understanding of public perception and</div>
                <div>manipulating his popularity. This led him to the realization that if he wants to control</div>
                <div>Germany, he needs to control the Church. Eventually, Hitler would put into law what would</div>
                <div>be referred to as the ‘Aryan Paragraph’ which among many things banned ethnic Jews from</div>
                <div>pastoring in the German Church, <span>even</span> if they were already ordained.</div>
            </div>
            <div><br></div>
        </div>
        <div id="pf3">
            <div>
                <div><br></div>
                <div>In response, Bonhoeffer wrote a pamphlet on the <span>Jewish Question</span>, where he wrote, “The</div>
                <div>fact, unique in history, that the Jew is subjected to special laws by the state, solely on the</div>
                <div>basis of his race and regardless of the religion to which he adheres, presents theologians</div>
                <div>with two new problems, which must be dealt with separately. How does the church judge</div>
                <div>this action by the state, and what is the church called upon to do about it? What are the</div>
                <div>consequences for the church’s position toward the baptized Jews in its congregations?</div>
                <div>Both these questions can only be answered on the basis of a right concept of the church”</div>
                <div>(The Church and The Jewish Question, 1933).</div>
                <div>Essentially asking, what is the church to do? Bonhoeffer lists 3 options of the church</div>
                <div>regarding the state [p. 153-4]</div>
                <div>1.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Be complicit in state actions under the pretext that the state is ordained by God.</div>
                <div>Romans 13 – “</div>
                <div>1</div>
                <div>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is</div>
                <div>no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.</div>
                <div>2</div>
                <div>Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and</div>
                <div>those who resist will incur judgment.</div>

                <div>For rulers are not a terror to good conduct,</div>
                <div>but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is</div>
                <div>good, and you will receive his approval,</div>
                <div>4</div>
                <div>for he is God's servant for your good. But if</div>
                <div>you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant</div>
                <div>of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.</div>
                <div>5</div>
                <div>Therefore one</div>
                <div>must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of</div>
                <div>conscience.” Certainly a passage used by Christian Nazi’s to follow Hitler.</div>

                <div>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see</div>

                <div>44</div>
                <div>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or</div>
                <div>thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’</div>
                <div>45</div>

                <div>Many were complicit, option one, especially at the beginning when they had no idea of the</div>
                <div>horrors to come, and even when they began to know they remained complicit out of fear or</div>
                <div>corrupted faith in the Reichkirche (Germany Nazi Church). This was explored on the front</div>
                <div>lines of the Third Reich by Christopher Browning in Ordinary Men. In Ordinary Men,</div>
                <div>Browning shows the transformation of average men into Nazi killing machines. He writes,</div>
                <div>“Along with ideological indoctrination, a vital factor touched upon but not fully explored in</div>
                <div>Milgram’s experiments was conformity to the group. The battalion had orders to kill Jews,</div>
                <div>but each individual did not. Yet 80 to 90 percent of the men proceeded to kill, though</div>
                <div>almost all of them – at least initially – were horrified and disgusted by what they were</div>
                <div>doing. To break ranks and step out, to adopt overtly nonconformist behavior, was simply</div>
                <div>beyond most of the men. It was easier for them to shoot” (Ordinary Men: Reserve Police</div>
                <div>Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland)</div>
                <div>Fewer, though many stories exist, were those who helped those afflicted (option two). We</div>
                <div>have movies for them, like Schindler’s List, and we have heard of the many efforts to help</div>
                <div>Jews escape the persecution of Nazi Germany. Even fewer were those who were ready to</div>
                <div>stand-up and try to break the Third Reich itself (option three). Of those three options, be</div>
                <div>complicit, assist the afflicted, and break the wheel, Bonhoeffer would work towards the</div>
                <div>ends of options 2 and 3 (assisting, and breaking), because for Bonhoeffer, “silence in the</div>
                <div>face of evil, is in itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to</div>
                <div>act is to act.”</div>

                <div><br></div>
                <div>From the beginning, Bonhoeffer saw the separation of Jews from the church as</div>
                <div>incompatible with the Gospel. It wouldn’t be long before Hitler would ban ethnic Jews from</div>
                <div>serving as clergy, throwing out the Old Testament, working on a translation of the New</div>
                <div>Testament that removes any ‘Jewishness’ from it, and replacing the crosses with</div>
                <div>swastikas. And from this Reinhard Heydrich said “You’ll see the day, ten years from now,</div>
                <div>when Adolf Hitler will occupy precisely the same position in Germany that Jesus Christ has</div>
                <div>now” [p. 165]. And Hitler to say “It’s been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why</div>
                <div>didn’t we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the</div>
                <div>highest good? The Mohammedan religion too would have been much more compatible to</div>
                <div>us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?”</div>
                <div>[p. 165]</div>
                <div>While Bonhoeffer was always openly critical of Hitler and the Nazi regime, he had a</div>
                <div>powerful understanding of making sure he took the right steps in making his voice heard. In</div>
                <div>correspondence with his grandmother, he noted that the sooner the church can separate</div>
                <div>itself from this the better [p. 185]. Bonhoeffer had the restraint to make sure that the</div>
                <div>defining schism was the German Nazi Church breaking off from the true Faith. He went out</div>
                <div>and met with various church leaders, many of whom were reluctant to take such a step</div>
                <div>towards separation in the church, but Bonhoeffer helped lead the charge and pen the</div>
                <div>words that would start the Confessing Church.</div>
                <div>This seems like a point we should take an aside to mention some of the other true believers</div>
                <div>who joined with Bonhoeffer to stand courageously against the Third Reich. Martin</div>
                <div>Neimöller, a fellow pastor who helped form the Confessing Church, initially supported</div>
                <div>Hitler’s rise to power, but later became the man who penned the famous words</div>
                <div>First they came for the socialists, but I did not speak out—</div>
                <div>Because I was not a socialist.</div>
                <div>Then they came for the trade unionists, but I did not speak out—</div>
                <div>Because I was not a trade unionist.</div>
            </div>
            <div><br></div>
        </div>
        <div id="pf7">
            <div>
                <div><br></div>
                <div>Then they came for the Jews, but I did not speak out—</div>
                <div>Because I was not a Jew.</div>
                <div>Then they came for me,</div>
                <div>and there was no one left to speak for me.</div>
                <div>This is also the time Bonhoeffer is growing his ecumenical contacts, and particularly those</div>
                <div>with Bishop Bell in London, who would later be an intermediary between the German</div>
                <div>resistance against Hitler and the British government.</div>
                <div>During this time, Bonhoeffer would continue his writings, continue pastoring various</div>
                <div>communities around Europe, and eventually find himself at Finkenwalde. This was a secret</div>
                <div>place for training Confessing Church Pastors. These trainees were only slightly younger</div>
                <div>than Bonhoeffer himself, but they would fill themselves with studying the Word and</div>
                <div>seeking to understand the Will of God. Bonhoeffer was known for teachings, but also his</div>
                <div>methods for studying scripture. He had all students spend 30 minutes everyday with a</div>
                <div>single verse and meditate on that verse. Not relying on other commentaries for revelation,</div>
                <div>or for seeking the understanding provided by others. Instead, he believed that each of them</div>
                <div>had a Helper with them that can provide true revelation. They had regular readings (going</div>
                <div>through the psalms monthly, and morning and evening teachings), but they also had</div>
                <div>wonderful fun. Regularly Bonhoeffer would sit at the piano and the music would fill the air,</div>
                <div>or the soccer ball would come out, or maybe a ping-pong tournament. It was a true</div>
                <div>community, with a mission of seeking God.</div>
                <div>Eventually, the Gestapo closed Finkenwalde. At that point, 113 students had been trained,</div>
                <div>but the students there at the time of shutdown were conscripted into the army of the Third</div>
                <div>Reich or sent to the concentration camps. It was at this time all Germans of age were being</div>
                <div>given the choice to join the army or face the consequences. This forced Bonhoeffer to</div>
                <div>decide what he was going to do next. He was banned from publicly preaching in Germany</div>
                <div>and was likely to be conscripted into the military at any moment. He decided to take an</div>
                <div>invitation form Union Theological Seminary in New York. Providing him a haven from which</div>
                <div>the Third Reich can’t reach.</div>
            </div>
            <div><br></div>
        </div>
        <div id="pf8">
            <div>
                <div><br></div>
                <div>This lasted six weeks, upon which Bonhoeffer had convictions in his heart that he left his</div>
                <div>family, his friends, and his country, and knew God could use him in Germany. Being back in</div>
                <div>Germany, Bonhoeffer met with his brother-in-law Hans Dohnanyi who brought him into the</div>
                <div>Abwehr, the Third Reich intelligence, to protect him from the conscription.</div>
                <div>Throughout all of this, there was a growing movement within Hitler’s close circle to</div>
                <div>assassinate the Fuhrer. It was here that Bonhoeffer functioned as a double agent for the</div>
                <div>conspiracy. His official title was counterintelligence officer for the Abwehr. In this position,</div>
                <div>he was to gather intelligence for the German military about foreign influences, but secretly</div>
                <div>he used this as a cover to help the resistance. Bonhoeffer, as part of the Abwehr, was</div>
                <div>allowed to travel internationally, giving him the cover to inform England of the</div>
                <div>assassination plan in hopes that England would (1) help in planning of the assassination</div>
                <div>and (2) ensure that once Hitler was dead England would end the war peacefully. To this</div>
                <div>end, Bonhoeffer met with his colleague Bishop Bell, who had close ties to the Anthony</div>
                <div>Eden, to try and pass information from the resistance to the British leadership.</div>
                <div>Unfortunately, the British were unwilling to be a part of an assassination attempt</div>
                <div>considering the possibility that it would lead to a complete invasion of England by Nazi</div>
                <div>forces if it failed. This was furthered by the Allied powers wanting an unconditional</div>
                <div>surrender of Nazi Germany.</div>
                <div>While in this position as double agent, Bonhoeffer was able to help smuggle Jews out of the</div>
                <div>country into Switzerland. This plan would later be known as operation seven (though the</div>
                <div>plan expanded to saving 14 Jews). </div>
                <div>He would continue this work in the Abwehr from 1940 until his arrest on April 5</div>
                <div>th</div>
                <div>1943. They</div>
                <div>came to him and his parents’ home, and Bonhoeffer walked out with his Bible in his hand</div>
                <div>and got into the black van [p. 433]. This would be the last time he would ever set foot in that</div>
                <div>home. From there, he was taken to a prison in Berlin, Tegel military prison, where he would</div>
                <div>send his letters that would later make up the book <span>Letters and Papers from Prison</span>.</div>

                <div><br></div>
                <div>This makes us beg the question, how is a pacifist theologian going to handle prison? The</div>
                <div>answer, strangely well. His first letter back to his parents he notes, “Strangely enough, the</div>
                <div>discomforts that one generally associates with prison life, the physical hardships, hardly</div>
                <div>bother me at all… A violent mental upheaval such as is produced by a sudden arrest brings</div>
                <div>with it the need to take one’s mental bearings and come to terms with an entirely new</div>
                <div>situation – all this means that physical things take a back seat and lose their importance,</div>
                <div>and it is something that I find to be a real enrichment of my experience. I am not so unused</div>
                <div>to being alone as other people are, and it is certainly a good spiritual Turkish bath….</div>
                <div>Besides that, I have my Bible and some reading matter from the library here, and enough</div>
                <div>writing paper now.” [Letters p.22]. Admittedly some of this was likely to help comfort his</div>
                <div>parents. His first two weeks were in complete solitary confinement, but this, and the</div>
                <div>remainder of his imprisonment, is where we see into the Truth seeking that Bonhoeffer had</div>
                <div>for the Lord’s Will.</div>
                <div>“From the beginning of his time until the end, Bonhoeffer maintained the daily discipline of</div>
                <div>scriptural meditation and prayer he had been practicing for more than a decade. Each</div>
                <div>morning, he meditated for at least half an hour on a verse of Scripture. And he interceded</div>
                <div>for his friends and relatives, and for his brothers in the Confessing Church who were on the</div>
                <div>front lines or in concentration camps. Once he got his Bible back he read it for hours each</div>
                <div>day. By November [8 months after his arrest], he had read the Old Testament two and a</div>
                <div>half times. He also drew strength from praying the Psalms, just as they had done at Zingst,</div>
                <div>Finkenwalde, Schlawe, Sigurdshof, and elsewhere. Bonhoeffer once told Bethge, who was</div>
                <div>about to embark on a trip, that it was all the more important to practice the daily</div>
                <div>disciplines when away, to give oneself a sense of grounding and continuity and clarity” [p.</div>

                <div>We could go on and talk about the details of the various assassination attempts (of which</div>
                <div>there were many that Bonhoeffer was involved in or connected to). We could go on to talk</div>
                <div>about the fact he became the <span>de facto&nbsp;</span>pastor for the prison, where guards would come to</div>
                <div>him for advice. We could go on to give more details about how his writings have continued</div>
                <div>to be classics and insightful Christian literature.</div>

                <div>We could even note how his time spent in racially segregated America prepared him for the</div>
                <div>signs of racism in Germany. But what I think Bonhoeffer would rather have us do is simply</div>
                <div>look back at the Word of God. Bonhoeffer is interesting, I think, because of his</div>
                <div>unquestionable, unwavering, and unbreakable desire to follow the Will of God, even and</div>
                <div>especially when it goes into uncomfortable territory. Should a Christian go against the</div>
                <div>state? Should a Christian be willing to lie and spy and act as a double agent against the</div>
                <div>state? Should a Christian help plot an assassination? I don’t think these questions have</div>
                <div>any good answers, but Bonhoeffer was so soaked in the Word of God, and because of that I</div>
                <div>can’t help but believe his answers couldn’t have been far from God’s Will.</div>
                <div>43</div>
                <div>“For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit,</div>
                <div>44</div>
                <div>for each</div>
                <div>tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes</div>
                <div>picked from a bramble bush.</div>

                <div>The good person out of the good treasure of his heart</div>
                <div>produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the</div>
                <div>abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.” [Luke 6:43-45 ESV]</div>
                <div>1</div>
                <div>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord</div>
                <div>Jesus Christ.</div>
                <div>2</div>
                <div>Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which</div>
                <div>we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</div>
                <div>3</div>
                <div>Not only that, but we rejoice in our</div>
                <div>sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,</div>
                <div>4</div>
                <div>and endurance produces</div>
                <div>character, and character produces hope,</div>
                <div>5</div>
                <div>and hope does not put us to shame, because</div>
                <div>God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to</div>
                <div>us. [Romans 5:1-5]</div>
                <div>Bonhoeffer would remain in prison until April 9, 1943, when he was hung after Hitler found</div>
                <div>the diaries of a fellow conspiracy member and ordered all members associated with the</div>
                <div>assassinations executed immediately.</div>
                <div>At his death, the prison doctor noted: “I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer kneeling on the floor,</div>
                <div>praying fervently to God … so certain that God heard his prayer …. I have hardly ever seen a</div>
                <div>man die so entirely submissive to the will of God.” [p. 237] “What made him stand out …</div>
                <div>was that he did not hope that God heard his prayers, but knew it.” [p. 237]</div>

                <div>Was Bonhoeffer a martyr? A martyr is “a person who is killed because of their religious or</div>
                <div>other beliefs”. Bonhoeffer was <span>not</span> arrested for being Christian. He was arrested in his</div>
                <div>family home in 1943 for his part in Operation 7. <span>Nor</span> was Bonhoeffer sentenced death for</div>
                <div>being Christian. He was sentenced to death for his part in the plot to kill Hitler. But through</div>
                <div>all of this it was a belief in God’s plan for him that led him to take the actions he did, and</div>
                <div>because of this <span>he certainly has died for of his beliefs</span>. For if not for the convictions God</div>
                <div>placed in his heart, he might have lived the four weeks that separated his death and</div>
                <div>Germany’s surrender. He was killed for his actions against the Third Reich, but he <span>died</span> for</div>
                <div>his unyielding service to the cross. He truly was a citizen of Heaven.</div>
                <div>I want to end this talk with a quote from Bonhoeffer himself, which I think encapsulates his</div>
                <div>life significantly better than I ever could. We have to challenge ourselves to consider how</div>
                <div>we in our own lives can fight the good fight [2 Tim. 4:7], persevere under trial [James 1:12],</div>
                <div>and hold fast [Phil. 2:16] to the confession of our hope without wavering [Heb 10:23].</div>

                <div>baby Hitler. I’ll pose the rhetorical question, at what point should you as a Christian plan to</div>
                <div>kill Hitler, and some might argue should you? Reinhard Heydrick, head of the</div>

                <div>theologians with two new problems, which must be dealt with separately. How does the</div>
                <div>church judge this action by the state, and what is the church called upon to do about it?</div>
                <div>What are the consequences for the church’s position toward the baptized Jews in its</div>

                <div>peace and are ready to suffer at their hands. The peacemakers will carry the cross with</div>
